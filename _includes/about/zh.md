> Quantum transport, Solid state matter, Mesoscopic devices

Hey, I am **Zifan Xu**. A Student in University of Science and Technology of China majors in Applied Physics. 

My current interest focuses on **novel phases of electrons** in solid state matter and **mesoscopic devices** for applications in quantum inforamtion processing. 

I am now working on two undergraduate research projects: **(1)** Building a cryogenic measurement system, **(2)** Exploring LaArO3/SrTiO3 interface. More information is available in part of  ***Projects***
