Hey, I am **Zifan Xu**. A Student in University of Science and Technology of China majors in Applied Physics. 

My current interest focuses on novel phases of electrons in **complex oxides interface** and **mesoscopic devices** for applications in quantum inforamtion processing. 

I am now working on two undergraduate research projects supervised by professor Guanglei Cheng: **(1)** Build a cryogenic measurement system, **(2)** Exploring **LaArO3/SrTiO3 interface**. More information is available in the part of  ***[Projects](https://fanfan134.github.io/portfolio/)***
